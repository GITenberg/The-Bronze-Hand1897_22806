description: 'Anna Katharine Green (1846-1935) was an American poet and novelist.
  She was one of the first writers of detective fiction in America and distinguished
  herself by writing well plotted, legally accurate stories. She is credited with
  shaping detective fiction into its classic form, and developing the series detective.
  Her main character was detective Ebenezer Gryce of the New York Metropolitan Police
  Force, but in three novels he is assisted by the nosy society spinster Amelia Butterworth,
  the prototype for Miss Marple, Miss Silver and other creations. She also invented
  the ''girl detective'': in the character of Violet Strange, a debutante with a secret
  life as a sleuth.'
